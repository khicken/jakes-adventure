# jakes-adventure
A command line game with action and adventure, made in Java

Anyways this is meant to be an upcoming adventure/action/rpg game using Processing and Java (tested a couple things when created a command line version)
Once this is done, I'll probably transfer this into a 2D game in js.

If you'd like to play the game, clone the repo and run the "run.bat" file, and the program will automatically compile and run the application.
I'll release the game in an actual exe file and folder release once I feel the game is actually playable.

Issues, comments, or whatever is appreciated! (Unless you decide to do something that isn't. . .)
